Utilities you can use for backup testing

# Overview
Over the years I've periodically been in situations where I've needed to
test backup scenarios that aren't necessarily easy to have in your lab.
A dense filesystem for instance isn't something you're likely to have
just laying around on a spare server.

If you're in a situation where you need to test functionality within a
backup product relating to files or filesystems, these utilities may help.
